"articleBody": "One day 3 years ago after a night of heavy drinking and hard drugs I fell into an accidental coma. That coma was half induced by the drugs and half induced by the excitement I gathered at an idea that had come to me right as my consciousness was fading. When I arose almost a full month later without my original thought, I worked for almost 72 hours straight to try and strategically recreate the conditions that brought about the idea. After pushing my body to its limits once again I was able to remember the idea and write it down just before I slipped into another coma and that idea was car to helicopter conversion kits.",

The movie reminded me of the fantastical dreams I once had as a young child. It reinvigorated my spirit and imagination, and I aspired to recreate at least one thing from Meet the Robinsons to the best of my ability. I spent weeks devising a prototype that would satisfy my imagination’s hunger. When I finally made the first car-to-helicopter conversion kit, I felt my inner Goob’s happiness. What began as a simple nostalgia binge became something grander; it became HVRoadrunner.",
"articleSection": "Why Roadrunner kits can't be self-installed",
"articleBody": "Installation of the Roadrunner conversion kit is a very important and delicate process. That is why it can only be done by a trained and certified Roadrunner engineer. Many problems can occur if the Roadrunner conversion kit is not properly installed, the most prominent of which is the kit tearing off the part of the car it is attached to. Another integral reason we do not allow self-installation is because if the conversion kit is not installed at the exact predetermined spot on the vehicle, it can significantly impact the efficiency of the system. This becomes a big problem when considering our carbon footprint, so the system needs to be set up to run at maximum efficiency to reduce the amount of pollution created as a bi-product."
